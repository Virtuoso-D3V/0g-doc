# Migrate to Cosmovisor for Running 0gchaind
This guide will walk you through migrating from using 0gchaind start [flags] to using Cosmovisor to manage your 0gchaind application. Cosmovisor offers the advantage of handling upgrades automatically without manual intervention.
## Steps to Migrate
### Step 1: Stop the Currently Running 0gchaind
Before migrating, ensure that the currently running 0gchaind instance is stopped. 
### Step 2: Download the Migration Script
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0glabs/0g-chain/dev/networks/testnet/init-cosmovisor.sh
### Step 3: Confirm the Path of 0gchaind
Use the whereis command to confirm the path of your 0gchaind binary: 
`whereis 0gchaind`
If the path returned by whereis 0gchaind is different from the path you are currently using to run 0gchaind, modify the script to use the current path. Open the script and replace the 0gchaind path with your current path.
### Step 4: Execute the Migration Script
`chmod +x init-cosmovisor.sh`

`./init-cosmovisor.sh (0G_HOME)`
### Step 5: Start 0gchaind Using Cosmovisor
Start 0gchaind using Cosmovisor with the following command:
`
cosmovisor start [flags]
`
## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, run the following command to check the Cosmovisor configuration:
`cosmovisor config`

This command will display the current configuration settings for Cosmovisor, helping you identify and resolve any potential issues.
